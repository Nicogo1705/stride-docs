## 🚀 Getting Started

All the information you need to get started with Stride Docs development can be found in the 📚 [Stride Docs - Contributing](https://doc.stride3d.net/latest/en/contributors/documentation/index.html).

## 🤝 Contributing

Use [Discord](https://discord.gg/f6aerfE) for questions and general discussions. 
Use [Issues](https://github.com/stride3d/stride-docs/issues) to report bugs and propose features.

We welcome code contributions through pull requests. Issues tagged as **[`help wanted`](https://github.com/stride3d/stride-docs/labels/help%20wanted)** are good candidates for starting to contribute code.

### Branching and Releases

The `master` branch is the default branch for pull requests and most other development activities. 

Releases are based on a stable `master` branch. Use of [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is encouraged.

The Stride Docs website is _not_ released on a regular cadence; new updates arrive when maintainers fix issues or see enough changes that warrant a new release.

### Staging

The staging website allows us to test new features and significant changes before their official release.

The staging website is available at [Stride Docs Staging](https://stride-doc-staging.azurewebsites.net/).

    Click **Install**.

13. The Stride Launcher asks if you want to install the Visual Studio integration. This lets you edit shaders directly from Visual Studio and provides syntax highlighting, live code analysis with validation, error-checking, and navigation. Installing the integration isn't mandatory, but we recommend it.

>[!Note]
> If you don't install the prerequisites, Stride won't run. In this case, you can download and install the prerequisites separately. For instructions, see [Troubleshooting â€” Stride doesn't run](../troubleshooting/stride-doesnt-run.md).
>
> Alternatively, uninstall Stride, restart the Stride installer, and install the prerequisites when prompted.
